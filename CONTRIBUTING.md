## Expectations for behavior
 
### General

* Check for overlap with other Pull Requests.
* Think carefully about the long-term implications of the change. How will it affect existing projects that are dependent on this? How will it affect my projects? If this is complicated, do I really want to maintain it forever? Is there any way it could be implemented as a separate package, for better modularity and flexibility?
* Don't add any classes to the metamodel unless absolutely needed

### Check the Code
* Review the changes carefully, line by line. Make sure you understand every single part of every line. Learn whatever you do not know yet.
* Take the time to get things right. PRs almost always require additional improvements to meet the bar for quality. Be very strict about quality. This usually takes several commits on top of the original PR.
* Write or request the needed docs.
* Ensure back-ward compatibility for every change that's accepted
